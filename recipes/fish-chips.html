        <p> Crispy battered fish, chunky chips and homemade tartare sauce, what's not to love? Serve with a good squeeze of lemon or vinegar, if you prefer. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>800g Maris Piper potatoes</li>
            <li>approx 500ml sunflower oil, for frying</li>
            <li>4 x 120g fillets white fish, eg hake or haddock​</li>
            <li>200g plain flour​</li>
            <li>50g cornflour </li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>250-300ml amber ale</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the tartar sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>3 tbsp half-fat crème fraîche</li>
            <li>4 large gherkins, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp capers, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 x 115g packs Tesco samphire</li>
            <li>lemon wedges, to serve​ ​</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 7, 220°C, fan 200°C. Cut the potatoes (unpeeled) into 1.5-2cm chips. Transfer to a baking tray and toss with 2 tbsp of sunflower oil. Bake in the oven for 45-50 mins until golden and crisp, turning once after 25 mins.​ </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the fish. Preheat the oil in a large pan to a medium heat. It's hot when the tip of a wooden spoon bubbles when dipped in the oil, or a thermometer reads 180-190°C.​ </li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, season the fish well. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, cornflour, and baking powder. Slowly whisk in the ale until you have a thick batter the consistency of very thick cream – you may not need all of the ale.​ ​ </li>
            <li>Dip the fish in the batter and allow the excess to drip off, then drop into the hot oil. Cook for around 3 mins per side until a deep golden colour. Repeat with the remaining fillets.​ </li>
            <li>To make the tartar sauce, mix together all the ingredients, and season to taste. For the samphire, bring a small pan of water to the boil and blanch the samphire for 2-3 mins until just tender. Drain.​ </li>
            <li>Serve the battered fish with the samphire, oven chips, tartar sauce and a wedge of lemon.​ ​</li>
