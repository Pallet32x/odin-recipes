I learnt a lot about Git, specifically remembering to commit often instead of locking in and just making the entire project in one go. This doesn't come naturally to me so I kept having to catch myself and remember to do a big commit, usually after I had finished adding a whole page.

There must be quicker, easier ways to add lots of content to a page, especially copying each ingredient into a list tag which takes a long time. Perhaps there is a way to highlight a line and add the li tag afterwards?

Glad to have completed my first project in TOP, feel like I'm still on easy street though. Worried about when I hit the vertical wall learning curve that I remember reading out in the beginning...
